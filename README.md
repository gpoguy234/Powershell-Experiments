# Powershell-Experiments
Random Learning with Powershell

LKQuotinator.ps1 - Just run code in powershell to hear random quotes from LetterKenny

localDNS-Cache-checker.ps1 - Helps show what IP addresses your computer is reaching out too - good for forensics type stuff.

Works on Win7, but speech synthesis is better on Windows 10
