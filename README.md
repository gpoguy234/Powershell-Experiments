# Powershell-Experiments
Random Learning with Powershell, some scripts more useful than others.  Updated infrequently with ideas and security tricks

Several scripts are designed to parse data from other security tool outputs
- Qualys
- Fortinet firewall config
- windows system stuff
- hardening

LKQuotinator.ps1 - Just run code in powershell to hear random quotes from LetterKenny

localDNS-Cache-checker.ps1 - Helps show what IP addresses your computer is reaching out too - good for forensics type stuff.

Works on Win7, but speech synthesis is better on Windows 10 (also tested on Win 2016 for the serious fans)
